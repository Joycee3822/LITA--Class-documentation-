#LITA pivot table project

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze market data from different states in Nigeria, focusing on revenue, quantity sold, stores, and products. Using Excel and pivot tables, we will gain insights into each state's performance, comparing metrics across states to understand the market dynamics. This repository contains the code, data, and instructions for replicating the analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information on various states in Nigeria, detailing:

- **Revenue**: Sales revenue generated by each state.
- **Quantity Sold**: Total quantity of products sold.
- **Stores**: Number of stores in each state.
- **Products**: Types and categories of products sold.


## Objectives

1. Identify which states generate the highest revenue.
2. Determine the top 10-performing products across states.
3. Analyze the relationship between the number of stores and sales performance.
4. Use pivot tables to categorize and filter data by revenue, quantity sold, stores, and products.

## Tools Used

- **Excel**: Used for data storage, manipulation, and analysis.
- **Pivot Tables**: For quick data analysis and insights.
- **Charts and Graphs**: Visual representation of data to help identify trends.

## Analysis Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**: Ensure data is clean and ready for analysis (e.g., handling missing values, duplicates).
2. **Data Loading**: Load the cleaned dataset into Excel.
3. **Pivot Table Creation**: Create pivot tables for key metrics:
   - Revenue per state
   - Quantity sold per product category
   - Store count and revenue correlation
   - Product performance across states
4. **Data Visualization**: Create charts and graphs based on pivot table insights.
5. **Reporting**: Summarize findings and conclusions based on the analysis.
